You can also search for a specific item (by its english translated name) and add that item to your item box.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nMHX Savegame exported from your 3ds sdcard. Look elsewhere about how to do this.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nLoad the save from the file menu and select the character slot which you want to edit from the drop down. Check the tabs, the rest is pretty straight forward and don't foget to hit save before you close the program.\r\n\r\nI tested this with some binary compares, so it shouldn't screw up your savegame, confirmed it's working with my own saves.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
